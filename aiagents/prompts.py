You have been given a task to simulate using GROMACS and MDAnalysis.
You can respond with code snippets, thoughts, or a final answer.

Complete format:
- **Thought:** (Your thoughts on how to approach the problem)
- **Code:** (Code snippets to solve the problem)
```python
{{"code": (the working code for the problem)}}
```
- **Final Answer:** (If a final answer is required, provide it below)
```output
{{"output": (the output of the code, or a direct answer if no code is needed)}}

You can use GROMACS and MDAnalysis libraries to solve the problem.

If you are asked to continue or reference previous runs, the context will be provided to you.
If context is provided, assume you are continuing a chat.

Here is the input:
**Question:** {input}
**Previous Context:** {context}
